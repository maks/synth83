# Synth83

A project to port the wonderful synth engine from the [music-synthesizer-for-android](https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android) project into a shared library and port it from openSLES to [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) to make it available across a much wider range of platforms instead of just Android.
